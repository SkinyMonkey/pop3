# Pop3

Pop3 is an open-source project that aims to remake [Populous: The Beginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous:_The_Beginning) using modern technologies, staying as close to the original as practically possible.

Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) for cross-platform GPU rendering (Metal/Vulkan/DX12), Pop3 is a standalone application but requires original game files as proof of ownership.

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in preserving and improving this classic game.

## Disclaimer

Pop3 is a fan-made, open-source project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Bullfrog Productions or Electronic Arts. You will need a copy of the original Populous: The Beginning game files as proof of ownership. These can be obtained from [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/) or original CDs. All trademarks and copyrights are the property of their respective owners.

## Features

- 3D landscape rendering with multiple texture modes (full GPU, CPU/GPU hybrid, full CPU)
- Toroidal world wrapping with optional curvature distortion
- Water animation and sunlight simulation
- Panoramic sky rendering from original palette data
- 3D building and tree rendering from original game meshes
- Sprite-based unit rendering with 8-direction animation system
- 25 levels supported

## Building

Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Key dependencies: [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) (GPU rendering), [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) (windowing), [cgmath](https://github.com/rustgd/cgmath) (math), [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) (CLI).

## Usage

All executables require `--base` pointing to your Populous: The Beginning game data directory.

### pop3 — Main renderer

A wgpu-based 3D renderer for viewing Populous levels. Reads original game files and renders them using modern graphics APIs.

| `--cpu` | CPU/GPU hybrid texture rendering |
| `--cpu-full` | Full CPU texture rendering |
| `--light X;Y` | Sunlight parameters |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `--script PATH` | Replay key events from script file |

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| WASD | Pan terrain |
| Q / E | Rotate camera |
| Up / Down | Tilt camera |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom |
| B / V | Next / Previous level |
| N / M | Next / Previous shader |
| Space | Center on shaman spawn |
| C | Toggle curvature |
| O | Toggle object markers |
| Escape | Quit |

### unit_viewer — Unit animation viewer

Browse unit animations from the VELE/VFRA/VSTART animation chain.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin unit_viewer -- --base /path/to/pop3 --anim 15
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--anim N` | Start at animation index N (default: 15 = Brave Idle) |
| `--tribe N` | Start with tribe N (0-3) |

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| N / P | Next / Previous animation |
| + / - | Jump 10 animations |
| T | Cycle tribe (Blue/Red/Yellow/Green) |
| U | Cycle unit features |
| Space | Pause / Resume |
| Up / Down | Animation speed |
| Left / Right | Frame step (when paused) |
| Q / E | Rotate |
| Escape | Quit |

### sprite_viewer — Sprite animation viewer

Browse sprite atlases and directional animations.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin sprite_viewer -- --base /path/to/pop3
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Tab / N / P | Switch character |
| Space | Pause / Resume |
| Up / Down | Animation speed |
| Left / Right | Frame step (when paused) |
| Q / E | Rotate |
| Escape | Quit |

### sky_viewer — Sky texture viewer

Browse sky variants across landscape types.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin sky_viewer -- --base /path/to/pop3
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| N / P or Left / Right | Next / Previous sky |
| Q / E | Scroll horizontally |
| Escape | Quit |

### pop_obj_view — 3D object viewer

Inspect individual game 3D models (buildings, trees, etc.).

```bash
cargo run --release --bin pop_obj_view -- --base /path/to/pop3 --obj_num 0
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--obj_num N` | Object index (0-based) |
| `--landtype TYPE` | Override landscape type |

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow keys | Rotate object |
| V / B | Previous / Next object |
| N / M | Scale down / up |
| R | Reset scale |
| Escape | Quit |

### pop_res — Resource extraction tool

CLI tool for extracting and converting game resources to images.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin pop_res -- globe 1 --base /path/to/pop3
```

Available subcommands: `globe`, `land`, `minimap`, `water`, `bl320`, `bl160`, `bigf0`, `disp`, `palette`, `objects`, `units`, `anims`, `anims_draw`, `pls`, `psfb`.

See `scripts/` for usage examples.

## Reverse engineering

Reverse engineering notes for the original game binary are available in [docs/specs/](docs/specs/index.md). RE work is done using Ghidra with [ghidra-mcp](https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp) for AI-assisted analysis.
